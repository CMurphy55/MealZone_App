App Name: Meal Zone
Documentation:
The app is a continuation from last semesters app. There have been massive improvements since last semesters app. I received a poor grade for the last assignment, so I wanted to showcase my skills this time around.
I created a bottom navbar. This was created by connecting the fragments together. I created Navbar.xml view with custom code to assign a bottom navigation view, here there are three fragments together with their own icons. These fragments are joined in a navigation view ‘my_nav.xml’. I wanted to store the data saved on the create fragment straight to the recycler view, this proved difficult. I created an activity to store the data with JSON saving. I created file helpers to save the images. 
App was previously known as ‘Transfer Hub’, now known as ‘Meal Zone’ . 
Many UI changes, including logo, fonts, colour schemes, recycler view and more.
Firebase log in was attempted but unable to complete. 
Swipe to delete is working in recycler view.
To get the create working I needed the landing page to be a fragment and a create page on an activity. This was working, but for some reason, I kept receiving the error ‘android.view.InflateException: Binary XML file: Error inflating class fragment’. I tirelessly tried to get it back working but could not in time for the final submission. Therefore, in my demonstration, the create function is not working.
I plan to fix this after the project is uploaded. Overall this is my best work over the whole year of Mobile App Development.
